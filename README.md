# Movie Recommendation System

Predict movie recommendations based on data analysis and machine learning, enhancing your cinematic experience.

## Overview

This GitHub project is dedicated to building a movie recommendation system using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. By analyzing movie tags, such as overview, genres, and keywords, and utilizing cosine similarity, this project provides personalized movie suggestions to users. Enhance your movie-watching experience with this intuitive recommendation system!

## Features

- **Data Loading**: The project starts by loading movie data from CSV files and merging relevant information into a Pandas DataFrame.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed to extract information from JSON columns (genres, keywords, cast, and crew), clean text data, and create a tag-based representation of movies.

- **Vectorization**: Tags are vectorized using CountVectorizer to enable similarity calculations.

- **Cosine Similarity**: Cosine similarity is employed to measure the similarity between movies based on their tag vectors.

- **Recommendation Engine**: The project includes a `recommend` function that takes a movie title as input and suggests similar movies based on cosine similarity scores.

## Requirements
